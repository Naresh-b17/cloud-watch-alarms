# ðŸ“Š AWS CloudWatch Metric Filter Patterns - Example Use Cases

This document contains commonly used **CloudWatch Metric Filter Patterns** for ALB, API Gateway, or Application Logs (in JSON/CLF format), along with their **use cases**.

---

## âœ… 1. All 4xx/5xx Errors in API Paths

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="* /api/*", statusCode=%[4-5][0-9]{2}%, bytes, referrer="*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Capture all client-side (4xx) and server-side (5xx) errors happening on any API endpoints. Useful for API health monitoring.

---

## âœ… 2. POST Requests to Specific API

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="POST /your/api/resource/*", statusCode=*, bytes, referrer="*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Monitor POST requests to a specific API resource (e.g., data submission endpoints). Helps track API usage or troubleshoot post failures.

---

## âœ… 3. All Requests from Frontend Domain

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="*", statusCode=*, bytes, referrer="https://your-frontend-domain.com/*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Filter and analyze all incoming requests where the referrer is your frontend app. Useful for tracing frontend-originated traffic.

---

## âœ… 4. GET Requests Returning 200 OK

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="GET *", statusCode=200, bytes, referrer="*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Track successful GET API responses. Useful for monitoring uptime and usage of public GET endpoints.

---

## âœ… 5. Large Payload Responses (>100KB)

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="*", statusCode=200, bytes>100000, referrer="*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Monitor large payload deliveries. Useful for bandwidth monitoring, cost analysis, and preventing oversized API responses.

---

## âœ… 6. All Admin API Requests

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="* /admin/*", statusCode=*, bytes, referrer="*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Track all hits to admin-level API endpoints for auditing and security monitoring.

---

## âœ… 7. All 5xx Server Errors

**Filter Pattern:**
```
[ip, identity, user, timestamp, request="*", statusCode=%5[0-9]{2}%, bytes, referrer="*", user_agent]
```

**Use Case:**  
Catch all server-side errors across the application, irrespective of the path or request type. Useful for backend health monitoring.

---

âœ… **Pro Tip:**  
Once you create these Metric Filters in CloudWatch, you can set up **Alarms**, trigger **SNS notifications**, or visualize these metrics in **CloudWatch Dashboards**.
